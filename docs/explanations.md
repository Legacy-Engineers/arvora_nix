A Windows compatibility layer (like Wine on Linux, or Proton on Steam Deck) doesnâ€™t just "take a .exe and run it" directly â€” because .exe files are Windows-native executables that expect Windows system calls, APIs, and drivers.

Hereâ€™s what actually happens under the hood:

1. ## Loader
  The compatibility layer provides a loader that can recognize Windows Portable Executable (.exe / .dll) format and map it into memory, just like Windows does.

2. ## System Call Translation
  When the program tries to talk to Windows (e.g., file operations, registry access, networking, DirectX), the layer intercepts those calls and translates them into equivalent Linux/Unix/macOS system calls.

Example:

- Windows program: CreateFile("C:\\Users\\file.txt")
- Compatibility layer: Converts to open("/home/user/file.txt", O_RDWR)

3. ## Libraries / APIs
  Windows apps expect libraries like kernel32.dll, user32.dll, or d3d9.dll. A compatibility layer implements these libraries in a way that forwards them to the host system equivalents (e.g., X11/Wayland for GUI, ALSA/PulseAudio for sound, OpenGL/Vulkan for graphics).

4. ## Driver & Graphics Handling
  For things like DirectX, layers like DXVK translate DirectX â†’ Vulkan so the game/software can use your GPU through Linux drivers.

So the .exe isnâ€™t emulated instruction-by-instruction (that would be slow). Instead, the compatibility layer **runs the program natively on your CPU** but replaces Windows system services with its own implementations.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s why Wine is not an emulator â€” itâ€™s a **reimplementation of Windows APIs**.
(The name literally stands for **Wine Is Not an Emulator ðŸ˜…**)
